# plasticity-models
This repository is dedicated to plasticity models used in material science.
The models include:
- Bouc Wen model that models kinematic hardening (yield surface translation)
- Von Mises plasticity model with combined isotropic and kinematic hardening including the saturations

  Keywords: Material plasticity, strain-controlled, Metal plastic behavior
